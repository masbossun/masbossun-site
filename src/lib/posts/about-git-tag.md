## Print Tags

```bash
git tag -l
```

or, if you want to print tag with the messages

```bash
git tag -n
```

## Create new tag

Let say we want to name the tag as `v1.2.3`, for latest commit we can assign it to `HEAD`

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 HEAD -m "Release 1.2.3"
```

But if we want to tag the specific commit, just put commit hash after tag annotation, for example the commit hash is `240743d`

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 240743d -m "Release 1.2.3"
```

The `-m` options means message.

## Push tags to remote

Tag that we create on local will not created on remote yet, so we need to push it

```bash
git push --tags
```
